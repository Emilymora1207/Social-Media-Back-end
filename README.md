# Social-Media-Back-end

## Description

This project is the back-end portion of a social media site. The site will eventually allow each user to post thier thoughts and allow users to react to thoughts. Through this project I was able to grow my knowledge in mongoose, and creating routes. 

## Installation

To install this project 
1. Open your integrated terminal. 
2. Install the needed dependencies by using `npm i`
3. Open insomnia

## Usage

Once you are in insomnia you can create, read, update and delete your users and user's thoughts as necessary. 

There are also routes that can be used to add and delete another user's id to the user's friend's list, and to add or delete a reaction to a thought. 

## Credits

I used express for the local server, and mongoose to create the database and schemas.
